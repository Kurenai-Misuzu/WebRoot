                I am a student at Bellevue college learning how to create and develop applications and software. I think that in a world where technology is close to the heart of everyone, knowing how to create and engineer software is an essential skill to have. I've been toying with software ever since I was a young teenager. I have experience with many different programming languages and am willing to learn more to be able to create anything I want with software.
